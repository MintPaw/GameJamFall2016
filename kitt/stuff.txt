While out on a moonwalk you hear distressed animal whining from the shadow of a crater. It's a little baby moon-demon, her leg snapped by some careless colonist's moon-bear trap.

You clean her wound and wrap it in moon-bandages. She struggles and tries to get away from you.

You curl up into the fetal position with her and vow raise her to eat the moon to stop people from being such dicks.

Cute little red pellets for a growing demon.
Level 1-10: +20 stamina
Level 10-25: +10 stamina

Trust+, Ferocity+, Stamina+ You pop a couple pellets past your demon's lips.
Trust-, Ferocity+, Stamina- She nearly bites your hand off to scarf down the pellets. / She tears a hole in the bag and devours every last of your Treatz. (lose all treats)
Trust-, Ferocity-, Stamina+ You hold some pellets out to her in a palm. She warily noses your hand until they drop, then picks at them.
Trust-, Ferocity-, Stamina- You toss her some Demon Treatz. She stares at you, backs away. Slowly she sniffs them... tastes one... devours them.
Trust-, Ferocity+, Stamina+ She snaps at your hand and gives a guttural growl... too proud to eat them, you guess?
Trust+, Ferocity+, Stamina- You hold out some Demon Treatz to her. She scarfs them from your palm, careful not to scratch you with her razor-teeth.
Trust+, Ferocity-, Stamina+ She's not very hungry, but she licks a couple out from the Demon Treatz bag anyway.
Trust+, Ferocity-, Stamina- She gives a cute little keening and happily slurps the Treatz from your palm. Once her belly is full she sprawls out lazily and demon-purrs.
Stamina max (She doesn't touch them. Too full.)
