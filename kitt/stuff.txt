While out on a moonwalk you hear distressed animal whining from the shadow of a crater. It's a little baby moon-demon, her leg snapped by some careless colonist's moon-bear trap.

You clean her wound and wrap it in moon-bandages. She struggles and tries to get away from you.

You curl up into the fetal position with her and vow to obliterate time itself to stop people from being such dicks.
